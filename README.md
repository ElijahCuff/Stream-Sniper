# **_PHP Stream Sniper_**
> Using PHP to bypass Free streaming restrictions on Broadcastify and Caster FM.

----
### BROADCASTIFY   
> Broadcastify streams are direct and require nothing more than the streaming link.    
### CASTER FM   
> To bypass a caster.fm stream, we need to request the Free Widget link to the stream and then extract the Authentication Token and Port number to the direct stream, once obtained - the script will start a passthrough of the streams bytes to the client . Pretty simple ðŸ¤”.
   
  
### Example Supported Links,   
_Broadcastify_    
```
